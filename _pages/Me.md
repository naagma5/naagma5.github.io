Hello there! Where do I begin?

I created [[What is Mind Blend Cafe?|Mind Blend Cafe]] after really getting clear about what made me feel most me. I've spent the past decade decoding my human experience and how I may want to design my life. After iterating through, I feel as I've converged to a sustainable way of approaching the world: exploring, connecting, and evolving with kindness, honesty, fun, wonder, and humility. 

[[What is Mind Blend Cafe?|Mind Blend Cafe]] is my way of documenting my experience and making sense of it all.
