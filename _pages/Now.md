I'm spending most of my days now applying for jobs. It has been a TOUGH search, to be honest. I'll keep it light here and will note that I've stumbled upon some roles that really ignite excitement. Based off of some of these, I had ChatGPT write me a job description which was kinda fun.

##### üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Questions on my mind ü§î : 
- [[How do you design for choice?]]
- [[How do you design for trust?]]
- In the culture today where every other headline is populated with talk of generative AI, how are people finding value on less technically advanced tools (ie. notebooks - Bullet Journal)? ([[When tech sucks]])
- What might be the effect on culture and our brains if generative AI stays behind the hype?
