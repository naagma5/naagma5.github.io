It's almost March! I'm having a pretty lovely start to the year. Much better than the end of 2023... 

I started running this year. My goal was to run a 5k without stopping and I'm happy to say I have done it! I had obviously heard of benefits but sticking with this fitness routine has drastically improved my quality of life. I hope to maintain it :) 

We're moving back to the Northeast! I am sad to say goodbye to Dallas. So many good friends and memories here. One more month to soak it up here.

I am also SO excited to be closer to my family and friends!! And NATURE. 

I fell off maintaining this site near the end of last year. Which is a bummer because I really do feel excited about this concept and growing this site as my personal digital garden. I am getting caught up in a perfectionistic mindset. 2024 me - let's break out of that!! 





<br>

#### TL;DR: Moving to NYC/Southern CT soon. Finding my fitness flow is helping me find flow in other aspects of my life. Soaking up time in Dallas until the move :)

##### 🙋🏽‍♀️ Questions on my mind 🤔 : 
- Why does your mind feel better when you workout?
- Why do we not want to say we've used AI when it's prevalent everywhere? 
- How can I connect back with this site and grow my "thought garden"?
