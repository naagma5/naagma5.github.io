#### Using Chemex
1. Boil water (enough to fill the kettle).
2. Measure and grind coffee beans to ~50g of coffee grounds (about sea-salt like texture).
3. Fold the Chemex filter using the triple fold technique (three vs one). Place the filter in pour over with the thicker (three fold) side positioned towards the spout. 
4. Once the water has boiled, pour enough to wet the filter. Swish and pour out the water. 
5. Add ~50g coffee grounds to the filter in the pour over. Shake so the ground bed is even.
6. Bloom: Pour about 100g of water in a circular motion about (enough to wet the grounds). This allows carbon dioxide that may have been trapped to be released.
7. Pour technique...

This is where things get weird.

##### Circle pour, center pour
I did like this technique and thought the coffee was good. It seems like this way isn't as popular as the timed circle pour. It was a lot easier and I didn't have to be as meticulous.

###### Circle pour from outside in
Did this and not sure if I really taste the difference. Is it worth the extra effort to time the pours?

###### Circle pour from inside out 
(Update - May 4. 2023) - Hard to tell the difference. I have been trying this technique and the coffee tastes good. However, it's really hard to control the pour even with my gooseneck kettle. Do I need to be taller? I might try to compare two cups made with the different techniques to see if I can even tell a difference.
