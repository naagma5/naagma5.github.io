title: Mind Blend Cafe - The Backstory
---


Gather round for here is the story of [[What is Mind Blend Cafe?|Mind Blend Cafe]]!! 

I wanted to build a digital presence for myself both personally and professional. As a budding designer/UX strategist, I needed a portfolio to be considered for roles. As someone who is into journaling, I also wanted to get more comfortable sharing my thoughts publicly. However, both efforts were stalled as I succumbed to perfectionism and procrastination. 

In March, I dreamily journaled what I would do with a million dollars and found myself wanting to open up a cozy coffeeshop designed to promote collaboration in creative ways - specifically in topics related to cognitive science. I was reminded of the French philosophers like Simone de Bouvier or Sartre having lengthy conversations about ideas in coffee shop like environments. A thought cafe! 

After a couple days, the name Mind Blend clicked for me and I was in love. I started dreaming of all the things it could be, what I wanted it to be, what was feasible and what I could make it if I was lucky. 

As I neared graduation, I also started thinking about my identity as a designer and someone headed into the field of UX/HCI in responsible tech. The questions I found myself most interested in centered on [[How do you design for choice?|choice/autonomy]], [[How do you design for trust?|trust]], lo-fi tech, effect of technologies on our brains, and ontology. 

In my head I wanted very much to combine the cozy coffee shop vibe with these questions I wanted to think about. After some iterations of designing a cafe like environment digitally and ways to promote engaged collaboration and idea evolution, I stumbled upon a community of people curating [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). 

Digital gardens appeared to be a safe place for people to nurture thoughts and grow ideas. It captured the essence of what I wanted to do with myself and how I wanted to design collaboration. Mind Blend Cafe is my cozy thought cafe modeled after digital gardens to explore, connect, and evolve ideas into insights. 

In future versions of Mind Blend Cafe, I hope to design a collaborative experience to collectively contribute to ideas.
