###### What I would tell a friend I haven't talked in a year


What I am most excited for in my life right now is that I am on track to officially graduate this summer (2023). This semester has been tough but I'm enjoying the work and I'm learning so much. I feel more confident in my skills specifically related to web design and machine learning. It probably helped that I was more involved in more than just my coursework this semester. I had the wonderful opportunity to get involved in a Cognitive Neuroscience lab measuring the relationship on Memory and Depression. I also participated in some conversations on building a parking lot museum exhibit using augmented reality. I feel really happy that I had so many conversations with interesting people on such interesting topics!! Fingers crossed I get to have more as a budding UX strategist (or similar role that captures what I want to do)!! 

With graduation nearing, I'm thinking about how much longer to stay in Dallas... I'm enjoying it a lot right now with a lovely group of friends and getting to know the city better. Eventually I will move back to be closer to my family but it doesn't have to be instantaneous. 

Once this semester is over (and I have a job), I think I want to get into rock climbing. I went for the first time a couple months ago and it was a lot of fun. It also makes me feel like I can take on challenging hikes (one of these days I'll fulfill my dream of being an outdoorsy gal!). For now - pickleball has been the affordable sport of choice (along with tennis). I also want to go explore more trails for long walks before it gets too hot... If only the dog was less interested in terrorizing people and animals at random!! 

I think that's it for now :) 

###### TL;DR: Soon to graduate, can't wait to be in the field (as a UX strategist?). Staying in Dallas (for now). Trying to get outside more. 



##### Questions on my mind: 
- [[How do you design for choice?]]
- [[How do you design for trust?]]
- In the culture today where every other headline is populated with talk of generative AI, how are people finding value on less technically advanced tools (ie. notebooks - Bullet Journal)?
- What might be the effect on culture and our brains if generative AI stays behind the hype?
