title: How to brew good coffee

#### Using Chemex
1. Boil water (enough to fill the kettle).
2. Measure and grind coffee beans to ~50g of coffee grounds (about sea-salt like texture).
3. Place Chemex filter in pour over with the thicker side towards the spout. 
4. Once water has boiled, pour enough to wet the filter. Swish and pour out the water. 
5. Add grounds to the filter + carafe. Shake so the ground bed is even.
6. Bloom: Pour about 100g of water in a circular motion.
7. Pour technique...

This is where things get weird.

##### Circle pour, center pour
I did like this technique and thought the coffee was good. It seems like this way isn't as popular as the timed circle pour. It was a lot easier and I didn't have to be as meticulous.

###### Circle pour from outside in
Did this and not sure if I really taste the difference. Is it worth the extra effort to time the pours?

###### Circle pour from inside out 
TBD.
