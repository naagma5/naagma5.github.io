Summary

This assignment is designed to give you practice evaluating interaction and visual design using common UX heuristics and defending and documenting your conclusions. This is one of the single most valuable skills you can develop as a UX/UI professional (or software developer) since it will help you make good decisions about how to create/change an interface without only relying on user testing

Instructions

Choose one of the tasks you listed above and complete a 10-item heuristic evaluation on the existing site you are evaluating as you walk through one or more task paths. At least two team members must participate. Keep in mind you may talk about how your task is not consistent with other parts of the site even if you are not reviewing the additional sections. You may use any of the heuristics from the Heuristic Evaluation lesson.

For each finding you include in your HE, include the following:

-   ﻿﻿A description of the issue.
-   ﻿﻿The heuristic violated.
-   ﻿﻿How critical you believe the problem to be.
-   ﻿﻿How you would suggest redesigning it OR how you would approach the problem of redesigning.

At least 7 of your findings must include annotated screenshots. You are not required to provide the HE project cover sheet covered in the lesson, but you should use it to think through planning the HE.![[Screenshot 2023-05-02 102205.png]]
