- Wanting to create a personal portfolio 
	- Kept getting stuck...
- Wanting to create a blog or share my musings [medium]
- Journaling response to if I had a million or unlimited dollars what would I do?
	- Open up a cozy coffee shop to have deep thoughtful conversations about the mind and any interesting topics (cognitive club, thought cafe?)

		Description: 
			Can the internet feel good? As digital technologies become integrated in almost every aspect of our lives, there is an interesting trend of rising exhaustion and anxiety. Many are finding refuge by disconnecting, returning to unplugged spaces like private journals or a cabin in the woods ([waldenponding](https://www.econtalk.org/venkatesh-rao-on-waldenponding/)) to escape from apps and technologies meant to boost productivity and connection.
			Mind Blend is [[Me|my]] digital space to imagine an alternate experience of the internet to explore, connect, and evolve. One that is calm, kind, fun, and evokes awe and inspiration. It is modeled after a community of people curating "[digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)" and "cozy internet" corners as spaces to think, reflect, and grow as a response to the chaotic stressful nature of the web. 
			With some development, Mind Blend will also be an invitation to others to join me in my cozy "digital thought cafe" to blend thoughts, feelings, ideas, and experiences to extract meaningful insights. My vision is that people start with a topic or question and feel encouraged to brain dump all their thoughts in a mindmap-like environment. Once they release their thoughts, they can look at others’ mind maps and may make new connections to their own. They may choose to go through this process as many times as they please but at the end, are asked to extract insights and make a "brew" of their ideas. The format of the ideas is open, and includes text, images, videos, gifs, and so on.

Before this... I had been journaling my thoughts and feelings through characters (embarrassing!!) But they would always land in a coffee shop to discuss their problems, experiences, etc.

	"This is cute, it is kinda like being a part of a real coffee shop: 
		'The Thought Cafe' - What did they used to call the pubcs they would go to to discuss ideas? In the time of the Enlightenment.
		Mug. Mind. Cozy Thought Cafe Coffee Warm.
		Anyway. So I'm thinking about that."

	"... How feasible is Mind Blend as a company. I absolutely love it. Can you imagine? For sure. We have (library) books, we've got coffee, chai, tea. Big cozy mugs. I can start with a blog post. Cognitive science. Discussion boards. Talks of discussions of the night. Good music. Dogs around. Yoga, meditation studio. Cozy seating. Somewhere you could bring your idea."

Alt Idea: Cognitive Cafe

March/April
From there I started to think about how I would actually design this experience digitally. 
Paralelly, I had been curating an identity for myself as a designer. I had questions that reflected my background in cognitive science and tech ethics. Those questions were 
1. Choice 
2. Authenticity
3. Lo-fi
4. Brains & technology 
5. What people can tell us about the field 

Design a digital experience simulating(?) a cafe/coffee-shop to... 
	Think about ideas.

Musings - deep in thought, contemplative

How it works: 



Example how do you design for choice

I didn't want people to be limited in how they "thought" so I wanted versatility in how to engage in the conversation topic. I also started to think about the iterative nature of the collective thinking process.


![[IMG_2465.jpg]]
Here you can see I started to think about the actual interaction between the people visiting Mind Blend and the different experiences they could have.



![[IMG_2466.jpg]]
Like an in person coffee shop, I recognized there were different modes of conversation group, 1x1, or with yourself. 




![[IMG_2467.jpg]]
Started to think about what these experiences might look like... 






![[IMG_2471.jpg]]
About this time is when I started to feel like I had strayed from what I had intented with Mind Blend. This was after I had gotten feedback on the perception of Mind Blend to be different than my intention. I decided to reorient myself to what was the reason I felt so excited about it. 
	I researched [[Ode to... Adriene Mischler|Adriene Mischler]] and [[Ode to... Andrea Savage|Andrea Savage]] because I absolutely love them and I felt they embodied a lot of what I wanted to do as well. 



![[IMG_2470.jpg]]
Again re-rooting to my ideas. I felt a little bit like in an effort to make Mind Blend unique, make it interesting to others, I was starting to lose sight of what it actually meant for myself - a cozy digital space for me to enjoy coffee and think about cool ideas. 

This is where things got really interesting for me...




![[IMG_2472.jpg]]
I found a cool process to capture the collective brainstorming method I had grown fond of. 



![[IMG_2473.jpg]]
I thought about the brainstorming process where you can marinate in your creative juices and get inspired from seemingly unrelated topics. I also wanted to capture how different people may have different journeys in brainstorming based on their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and ideas. I wanted to make sure people were able to have their own experience without input from others just their mind and themselves. Then they would be able to see others maps and iterate/gain inspiration for themselves.




![[IMG_2475.jpg]]
Above is an example of how to facilitate this experience and what tools I would use... I came up with the Brew as a way to define the synthesis of all these different mind blends.

A process walkthrough.





![[IMG_2476.jpg]]
Here things started to get interesting again. I walked into a world of people creating [digital gardens] - a place for people to tend to ideas and develop them in a non-linear format. 


![[IMG_2478.jpg]]
For this class, I decided to stick with first developing Mind Blend in such a way to showcase my design intention for people to feel like they are in a cozy coffee shop holding a giant mug of warm coffee/chai.

As I develp this project I'd like to build in the collaborative collective brainstorming corner
- include a way of recommending notes based on likelihood and build an ontology
- inlcude a way of recommending notes based on least likely 
- include a way of recommending notes based on randomness
-
