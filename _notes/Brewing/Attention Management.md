title: Attention management
---


"Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seems several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought." - William James

"My experience is what I agree to attend to." William James

"We're so used to distractions we get antsy when we don't have them."

"All the technology we constantly interact with has made us used to fast, short, and simple. We've started thinking of more cognitively demanding activities as difficult and unpleasant." 


"Mindfulness is a conscious mental state of recognizing the present moment, being aware of the sensations in your body, and acknowledging your thoughts and feelings."
