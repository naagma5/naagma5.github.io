###### ðŸ’­  Brewing....



Early March, I had to give a presentation as a part of my Critical Web Design class. The topic I choose was Deceptive Patterns with UX. 

I remember watching [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) and being deeply disturbed.

Choice? 

Choice is a fundamental expression of freedom. 

I think there are conversations happening regarding the existence of free will or not.

Thought experiments:

Let's say that every decision I make, my brain is right there with me. Neuroscience of choice. How did I choose to write these thoughts here?
- Narrator: I'm simply just observing and noting what has already been decided or chosen (happened). 
- Exogenous vs. endogenous processes... 
- *For example... I really wanted to message my family to update them on my school graduation situation. Where did that come from?*


Free will : the capacity or ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded
- Do we have control over our actions? What sort of control and to what extent? 
- Freedom of choice vs. freedom to act
- Being responsible for one's choices == they are the cause of their actions
- *But... what about split brain patients or when brain stops functioning in localized ways?*
- Determinism vs. 
	- Causal, logical, theological 
	- Compatibility [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett)] - people's sense of responsibility & purpose
- Quantum mechanics and choice 
- Statistical probability 
- What is rationality? 
- [Neuroscience of free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will): volition (voluntariness) and agency (capacity to act)
	- Roskies - 1. Action initiation 2. Intention 3. Decision 4. Inhibition & control 5. Phenomenology of agency
