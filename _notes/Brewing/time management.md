title: Time management
---

I have talked about this topic before (see [[Parkinson's Law]] and [[Book Notes - Four Thousand Weeks]]) but man is this something that is on my mind. A lot. 

I was rereading some of my old notes to declutter my digital space. I found this gem of an article on time. This quote in particular stuck out to me.
>“Modern man thinks he loses something – time – when he does not do things quickly. Yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains, except kill it.” - Erich Fromm

From multiple different angles, I can intellectually understand how idle time is good for me. Yet, I struggle so much with it. The minute I get some alone time, I think well... WHAT IS ON MY LIST?! And then realize I don't have the mental energy to do it and end up flittering to this discomfort with the time and then complaining about not having enough time. Yikes. 

I liked this article a lot. It has a lot of thought-provoking quotes and reflections on time. [How To Spend Time Without Fearing You've Wasted It. Part 2.](https://waysofthinking.co.uk/2022/01/25/time-part-2/)
