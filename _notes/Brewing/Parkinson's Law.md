title: Parkinson's Law & Time Management
---


[Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) is essentially that "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". 

This is an idea I've been thinking about as I say no to so many things to make time and space to study for my final exams... Do I really need all this time? Am I using it wisely? 

I feel pretty bummed missing my sister in law's baby shower. Luckily we have another one (perks of being married into an Indian family!) in a couple weeks. Still, this was the one my parents were throwing for her and it followed our family traditions.

Anyway, it has me reflecting on my time and how as I grow, I want to make sure I have a good strategy for time management. 

**How do you figure out what's important to you? How do you figure out what to do when multiple important things are happening in your life around the same time?** 

I'm thinking of Oliver Burkeman's book [[time management|Four Thousand Weeks - Time Management for Mortals]].

"You have to accept that there will always be too much to do; that you can't avoid tough choices or make the world run at your preferred speed; that no experience, least of all close relationships with other human beings, can ever be guaranteed in advance to turn out painlessly and well - and that from a cosmic viewpoint, when it's all over, it won't have counted for very much anyway."

So maybe next time I'm confronted with this kind of situation, I can ground myself on what's important. Probably [[Attention Management]] can help! Then I can figure out how to be okay with doing "good enough" so I can experience multiple important things ðŸ™‚ . At the very least, I can figure out how to stop putting the rest of my life on pause when there are exams or something similar at work in the future...
