The [Meet the Moonlight](https://jackjohnsonmusic.com/meetthemoonlight) album speaks to me in a spiritual way. 

I feel myself instantly feel calmer listening to the album especially when Meet the Moonlight. I don't know if that's because I associate doing [[yoga]] with it or if it's because it reaches my soul in the way. 

Jack's music always makes me feel really connected to the natural world. The music evokes curiosity and awe in a poetic way. Whenever I listen to his songs, I feel like I am taking a deep breathe, closing my eyes, and hearing the waves of the ocean.
