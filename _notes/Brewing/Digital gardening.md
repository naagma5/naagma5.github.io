My understanding of digital gardening, heavily inspired by Maggie Appleton
[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)


###### ðŸ’­  Brewing....

I feel very fortunate to stumble upon the concepts of [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). What excites me about this space is personal knowledge base, ontology, connection, and this idea of a digital space that's cozy and I can feel at ease. 

I spent so long trying to get a blog up but felt anxious succumbing to my perfectionism on not having the content be exactly how I imagined it would. To be fair, I was still processing and developing my ideas. This was a theme in my digital presence. I also overthought my posts on Instagram (along with having ethical concerns) - leaving me as an extreme lurker. My online identity was, in developer terms, staging. Never production. 

I think that's why I'm feeling so excited about digital gardens... Implicitly, they are meant to be works in progress. They are meant to be less production ready and more like publishing imperfect, developing ideas... "Imperfect by design".

"The right balance of chaos and structure." - Maggie Appleton in [Garden History](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

Right now I'm imagining [[What is Mind Blend Cafe?|Mind Blend]] to be the place where I bring my ideas and practice getting over perfectionism to share them publicly.

(A side effect I've accidentally discovered - a new way of organizing my online space to use Mind Blend's home page as a digital cafe space (YouTube atmosphere videos & Spotify playlists!)

Further understand:
- Streams vs. Gardens 
- Curated vs. curiosity
- Obsidian rabbit hole (starting with Notion and really loving Obsidian's philosophy)
- Campfires as conversational vs. personal gardens
