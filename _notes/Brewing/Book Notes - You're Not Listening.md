Book: You're Not Listening: What You're Missing and Why It Matters 
by Kate Murphy

This book is really helping me understand more on how to design a collaborative digital experience where people can listen and feel listened to.

"Listening that we engage, understand, connect, empathize, and develop as human beings."

To really listen is to be moved physically, chemically, emotionally, and intellectually by another personâ€™s narrative.

"It's also paying attention to how they say it and what they do while they are saying it, in what context, and how what they say resonates within you... A lot of listening has to do with how you respond - the degree to which you elicit clear expression of another person's thoughts and in, the process, crystallize your own. "

"Upon hearing the story, the listeners' brains began to show the same neural pattern as the speaker's. This coupling of syncing of brain waves is visible, measurable proof of the transmission of thoughts, feelings, and memories. "

"The scoring system measured several dimensions of listening, including emotional awareness, and body positioning. "

"Listening is about the experience of being experienced. It's when someone takes an interesting who you are and what you are doing. "

"It's the lack of presumption that you already know what someone will say, much less that you know better. "

"...paradoxically, it's uncertainty that makes us feel most alive."

"They listen well because they want to understand and connect and grow."

"The world is easier to navigate if you remember that people are governed by emotions, acting more often out jealousy, pride, shame, desire, fear, or vanity than dispassionate logic."

"People with higher IQs also tend to be more neurotic and self-conscious, which means worry and anxiety are more likely to hijack their attention."

"I think it's an issue of trusting that you can be imperfect in the conversation. Listening is a mater of you deciding you don't need to worry what to say next."

"'I'd like to think about that.' which conveys that you honor what the other person said by taking time to think about it, while, at the same time, honoring that part of you that is uncertain and needs time to process.'"

"... a faux pas creates an opportunity to fix it, which strengthens your tie the other person."

"Indeed, if you think about the people whom you trust and feel closest to in your life, they are undoubtedly the ones who have come back after a flub and made it right."

"It simply means you accept the legitimacy of the other person's POV and that you might have something to learn from it."

"... multiple truths and understanding them all might lead to a larger truth."

"One of her greatest talents is asking questions that don't rob people of their stories."

"Instead, Naomi turned her question into an invitation..."

"... and if you actually really, deeply understand the people the data, it will probably work even better."

"Which brings us to one of the more interesting and effective methods for improving employees' listening skills: improvisational comedy."

"It's really hard to people to do it successfully because they want to control where the story in going and they are already filling in the blanks about what they story should be about."

"The joy and benefit of human interactions come from a reciprocal focusing on one another's words and actions, and being ready and willing to respond."

"Funny is a by-product of honesty, intimacy, and familiarity."

"Intimacy, innovative thinking, teamwork, and humor all come to those who free themselves from the need to control the narrative."

"She says it's like a game of catch with lump of clay. Each person catches it and molds it with their perceptions before tossing it back." 

"... conversational sensitivity is related to cognitive complexity, which, as discussed earlier, means you are open to a range of experiences and can cope with contradictory views."

"Demonstrate interest either by learning people beforehand or being inquisitive in the moment. Try to find what excites them. It doesn't matter if it's their bottle cap collection; if they are passionate about it, it will be interesting."

"For whatever reason, often we are hesitant to stop and ask when we're not sure what someone meant."

"If you understood everything I said, you'd be me." 

"... how you talk to yourself affects how you hear other people."

"...studies have found that the voice-sensitive areas of the auditory cortex are activated more when reading direct versus indirect speech - that is, your brain reacts as if it's hearing an actual person speak when you read 'He said, I'm in love with her,' but not so much if you read 'He said he was in love with her.'"

"Your answer to someone else's deepest difficulties merely reflects what you would do if you were that person, which you are not."

I look back with enormous gratitude for an experience of being deeply listened to, but more than that, having this rare opportunity to listen to myself.

When peopel tell you how to feel or what you should do, I think that most of us know that it makes us defensive
	*Like when I tell Danny to do something and he gets all mean vs. when I give him hints. Does this mean [[passive aggressiveness]] might actually have a place?*

It's hard to ask open and honest questions because most people ask questions that are really recommendations or judgements in disguise.

Open and honest questioning is essential for basic understanding. It allows people to tell their stories, express their realities, and find the resources within themselves to figure out how they feel about a problem and decide on next steps.

Yoou feel busier trying to keep up, but it just keeps you from getting anything done.

Reasearch suggests that after people listen regularly to faster-paced speech, they have a great difficulty maintaining their attention when addressed by someone who is talking normaly - sort of like the feeling you get when you come off an expressway and have to go through a school zone.

When you hear people's stories, you tend to want to do right by them.

It's important to pay attention to what words conceal and silences reveal.

(Religion) try to listen to some higher order or, at least, to their best selves... Silence opens the mind to the inspirations of the Holy Spirt.

Gossip as a form of establishing and maintaining alliances...

The value of info is inversely related to its availability and its triviality.

When both parties in a conversation are focused and engaged, it's like a fantastic dance where the two of you are listening intently to each other regardless of who is speaking. Not only are your brain waves in sync (Uri Hasson) - but research shows you also start to physically and tonally align. You mirror each other's speaking style, body posture, gazes, and gestures.
	*This is the kind of experience I want brainstorming to be... Collaborative mind dancing!!! *

Their self-centered conversational style most often speaks to deep insecurities, anxieties, or blind spots. Sometimes just by listening, they begin to listen, too.... 
	*Sometimes I feel like... when I finally do get listened to, it's deeply uncomfortable like I am wasting their time. Like I'm going to fuck it up? Or like if I don't say the things that have been on my mind I'm going to miss out on this rare opportunity that someone is listening to me for once instead of me them...*


ðŸ‘€ Second Date Update

Part of being a good listener is knowing your limits and setting boundaries.... Not listening because you don't have the intellectual or emotional energy to listen at that moment makes you human. 

When you can't get on someone's wavelength

You are inviting someone into your consciousness
	Saying to someone "I've been thinking about what you said."

Hearing how other people deal with struggles helps you figure out how to deal with your own problems, either by adopting their coping strategies or doing the oppositie when it's not working for them. Listening helps you see we are dealing with similar issues - wanting to be loved, looking for purpose, and fearing the end. You learn you are not alone.

A good exercise is to think about the poeple in your life that
